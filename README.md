# 📊 AlgoLens

**AlgoLens** is a fully interactive, real-time Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) visualizer built for learners, educators, and developers. It visually demonstrates how various data structures and algorithms work under the hood, with clear animations, per-line code highlighting, and real-time explanations.
